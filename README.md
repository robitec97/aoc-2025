# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025 – Python Solutions

Welcome to my repository for **Advent of Code 2025**!
Here I am collecting day-by-day solutions to the puzzles, written in **Python**, each as a fully standalone script.

---

## 🚀 How to Run Solutions

Each part of each day is a separate script. Simply run:

```bash
python day01_part1.py
python day01_part2.py
```

Each script expects an input file named:

```
input.txt
```

📌 **Note:** Make sure the correct `input.txt` for that puzzle is placed in the same folder as the script.

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
.
├── day01_part1.py
├── day01_part2.py
├── day02_part1.py
├── day02_part2.py
├── ...
└── README.md
```

Each script:

* reads input automatically
* calculates the solution
* prints the answer directly
